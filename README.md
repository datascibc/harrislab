# harrislab
An R package containing miscellaneous functions to help the lab do its stuff

Feel free to submit a pull request to add in your own functions that you feel are of use to the group.
Some general design briefs:
- Try to keep the dependency footprint small, or consider adding a dependency to "suggests" if appropriate
- Lint your code against the tidyverse style guide before submitting
- Try to ensure your functions have reasonable unit testing coverage

Get in touch with Roma or Ed if you have any questions about getting your functions onboarded.
